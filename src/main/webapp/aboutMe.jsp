			I was introduced to computers and technology from a very young age; my father worked computer forensics for the local police department.
			I had a computer in my bedroom and I was always on it, tinkering with the OS and seeing what capabilities it had to offer.
			I also took basic computer and software classes throughout Elementary and Middle school but they always seemed so unfulfilling.

			During High School, a popular social media site at the time allowed for custom HTML to be embedded in various sections of the site.
			Numerous days were spent tinkering, tweaking, and researching what HTML and CSS were and how they could be utilized in different ways on my profile.
			My Junior Year, I found out that my school offered an Advanced Placement Java course, so signed up as soon as I could, and took it both semesters my Senior Year.

			At the same time, I grew to became my family's go-to "IT guy". I kept taking apart, rearranging, and reassembling the family computer's cords and peripherals as they
			continually became a tangled mess. Along with troubleshooting any wi-fi issues when the router decided to act up. I then wanted a computer to tinker with on my own
			without having to worry about consequences for others if I ended up breaking it, so I hopped onto Dell's PC builder website and "custom" built and ordered
			a Dimension E520 Desktop. It was delivered and I had everything opened, set up, and running smoothly inside a half hour.
